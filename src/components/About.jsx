        As a child, my fascination with computers began with the allure of video
        games, which eventually led me to delve into programming. However, it
        was during my voluntary service work in Africa that my passion for
        aiding others truly blossomed. Combining my acquired programming skills
        with this newfound desire to make a positive impact, I am dedicated to
        creating user-centric applications that serve the needs of their users
        effectively.

        My main focus now is to land a job for a company that values its users
        and shareholders. My motivation to <b>Go Forth and Code</b> comes from
        the knowledge that a single component developed can potentially help or
        make someone.
