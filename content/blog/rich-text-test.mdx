## Hyperlinks

Here are different link types to verify:

- External link: [Google](https://google.com) should open in a new tab
- Internal link: [Back to homepage](/) should use client-side navigation
- Email link: [Send me an email](mailto:neilspencerrafada@gmail.com)
- Inline URL in text: Check out [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more info

## Text Formatting

This is **bold text** and this is *italic text* and this is ***bold italic***.

You can also use `inline code` within a sentence.

## Code Blocks

TypeScript with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string
  slug: string
  published: boolean
}

function getPost(slug: string): BlogPost | null {
  const posts = getAllPosts()
  return posts.find((p) => p.slug === slug) ?? null
}
```

A simple bash command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
