## Hi there! I'm Spenz

It's 2026 and here I am talking about blog posts on my portfolio. 

I've been meaning to write a blog post for a while now, but I finally got around to it. I'm planning to write these blog posts without any use of AI. All from the top of the dome 🧠.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this blog post is the creator of [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/), [Peter Steinberger](https://steipete.me/). Like I mentioned above, I've always wanted to have a blog section for my portfolio, but I've never gotten the opportunity to flesh out the features, etc. Often, I get stuck in **analysis paralysis** and never continue the project. After reading his [article](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/shipping-at-inference-speed), I was inspired that I can *"un-dust"* all of the projects that I've put on hold and finally work on them. 

It's the beginning of February, but New Year's resolutions are never too late, right? **2026 will be the year that I will just keep on building and act on the ideas I have**. No more of the analysis paralysis of building the perfect software, but just imperfectly acting, building, learn fast, and iterate.

**Voila!** One of those project is this blog post. Another inspiration is to be able to articulate what I've learned and be able to share it with others. *I'm not the best developer, but I do love learning!*

## How I Built This Blog Feature

Well, I used Claude Code to build this blog feature. And no, this is not a plug or anything. Claude Code has always been my go-to tool for almost everything. From writing code, brainstorming, checking my inbox, everything! It is my daily driver.
I built this blog feature in parallel with 2 other projects. The three terminal setup in one window is something I'm definitely going to keep from Peter's dev setup/stack.

*But how did I come up with this implementation?*

To begin with, I used Claude Code to plan the implementation. I mentioned about the feature I want to work on and ask Claude to collaborate in creating a plan. 
One of the things that made me shelf this project was answering the question, "Where to begin?". I thought about CMS, admin page to manage the posts, etc.
So, I raised that concern with Claude and asked for its input. 

Three suggestions were given:

1. Use a headless CMS
2. Use MDX
3. Create an admin/secret page to write posts

I decided to use MDX since it is the path of least friction. Although some may question this decision, I made it mostly due to the fact that it is what I needed.
That is one of the mindset shift that I'm trying to change this year. 

> Do not overthink. Play with the tools I'm using. Test the output. Iterate. Change directions if needed.

I've come to learn that most of the agents available now produce great code. The beauty behind agentic development is the human touch we put into the outputs. We still have to understand that there are limitations to the tools we use (understanding business logic, reasoning, etc.),
but we can utilize our knowledge to guide these agents to the right direction.

## Future Plans (in general)

- I've un-dusted another project that I've worked on before. I don't know where it will lead, but I'm excited to see through the journey.

- Diving into the world of open source and contributing to the community. Already had my first [PR](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/6521) for OpenClaw!

- I'm also planning to expand the tools that I use. I'm going to explore Codex in the near future. The goal is always to optimize, learn, and iterate.

- Check this [noise color changer](https://spencer-rafada.github.io/noise-color-changer/) that I built for my baby. He said his first words ("dada" 😉) the next day, coincidence or not? Anyway, he is very obsessed with it!
I'm planning to add more onto it, but I'm not sure what yet.
