## Why Next.js 14?

When I set out to rebuild my portfolio, I wanted a framework that would give me
**great performance** out of the box while keeping the developer experience smooth.
[Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) with the App Router was the natural choice.

### The App Router Advantage

The App Router brings React Server Components to the table, which means I can
fetch data and render content on the server without shipping unnecessary JavaScript
to the client.

```typescript
// Example: A simple Server Component
export default async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPostBySlug(params.slug)
  return <article>{post.content}</article>
}
```

## Design Philosophy

I wanted the site to feel like a **developer's workspace** -- terminal-style code
blocks, monospace fonts for accents, and a dark theme that feels like home.

> "Good design is as little design as possible." -- Dieter Rams

### Key Design Elements

- **Glass morphism effects** for card backgrounds
- **Framer Motion** for scroll-triggered animations
- **Code-style comments** as section descriptors
- **VS Code Dark+** inspired color palette

## What I Learned

Building this portfolio taught me several things:

1. **Framer Motion** makes scroll animations surprisingly approachable
2. **Tailwind CSS** custom themes with CSS variables enable seamless dark/light modes
3. **MDX** is perfect for blog content that needs embedded React components
